### 1. **Client (CSV Upload)**
   - **Role:** The client uploads a CSV file containing URLs of images that need to be processed.
   - **Function:** The CSV file is sent to the server via an HTTP POST request.

### 2. **Express.js Server**
   - **Role:** The server manages the incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
   - **Function:** Handles the file upload, processes the image URLs, and orchestrates the image processing workflow. It triggers the necessary services, such as image downloading, compression, uploading to Cloudinary, and finally triggering the webhook.

### 3. **CSV Parser**
   - **Role:** Extracts image URLs from the uploaded CSV file.
   - **Function:** Parses the CSV content to retrieve a list of image URLs. The parsed data is then passed to the image processing service.

### 4. **Image Processing Service**
   - **Role:** Handles all image-related operations, including downloading, compressing, and uploading images.
   - **Functions:**
     - **Download Image:** Fetches the image from the provided URL using the `axios` library.
     - **Compress Image:** Reduces the size of the downloaded image using the `sharp` library by resizing and adjusting quality.
     - **Upload to Cloudinary:** Uploads the compressed image to Cloudinary, a cloud-based image hosting service.

### 5. **Cloudinary**
   - **Role:** Stores the processed images in the cloud.
   - **Function:** Provides a platform to upload and store images. The images are organized in a folder, and a unique public ID is assigned to each image. It returns a secure URL that can be accessed publicly.

### 6. **Webhook Trigger**
   - **Role:** Notifies an external system once all images have been processed.
   - **Function:** After processing all images, the webhook service sends a POST request to the specified webhook URL with data such as product ID and processed image URLs. This allows external systems to perform actions based on the completion of the image processing.

### 7. **Webhook Receiver (External System)**
   - **Role:** Receives the notification from the webhook.
   - **Function:** Handles the data sent by the webhook. This could be used for various purposes, such as updating a database, triggering further processing, or notifying users.

### 8. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - **Role:** Stores metadata about the processed images and their URLs.
   - **Function:** The server may store information such as the original image URL, processed image URL, product ID, and status of the processing task. This allows for tracking and retrieval of processed images.
